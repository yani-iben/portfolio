# [Project 1: Data Analytics in Healthcare](https://github.com/yani-iben/Data-Analytics-in-Healthcare)

This was a semester-long project I worked on for my Machine Learning class. 

* Real world data of over 100,000 instances was taken from 130 U.S hospitals. The dataset included various attributes including patient diagnoses and if the patient was readmitted.
* The best model was Random Forest, however other models including Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine were used.
* Cluster analysis identified key personas likely to be readmitted
* Project culminated in a series of business-focused recommendations to address hospital readmissions amongst diabetes patients.



# [Project 2: Hotel Relational Database](https://github.com/yani-iben/Hotel-Customer-Satisfaction/tree/main)

- **Relational Database Creation for Wilted Lotus**  
  - Designed and implemented a relational database in SQL to support hotel operations and analytics.  
  - Developed tables for key entities such as `Guest_Stay`, `Cleans`, `Orders`, `Supplier`, and `StaysIn` to manage data efficiently.  
  - Established relationships between entities using primary and foreign keys, ensuring data integrity.

- **Executed Queries to Identify and Resolve Business Problems**  
  - Queried customer feedback scores to identify seasonal trends in guest satisfaction.  
  - Analyzed feedback from repeat versus one-time customers to assess the impact of service quality on retention.  
  - Investigated the effect of late room cleaning on housekeeping scores by analyzing cleaning times.  
  - Evaluated supply chain processes by analyzing order times and delivery delays to identify inefficiencies.  
  - Identified specific suppliers contributing to delivery delays and proposed solutions.

- **Data Visualization Using R**  
  - Created bar charts to illustrate seasonal fluctuations in feedback scores across different service categories.  
  - Utilized boxplots to compare feedback scores between repeat and one-time guests, highlighting trends.  
  - Interpreted visualizations to support data-driven recommendations for operational improvements.  
  - Integrated insights from visual analysis with SQL query results for comprehensive reporting.
