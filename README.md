# [Project 1: Data Analytics in Healthcare](https://github.com/yani-iben/Data-Analytics-in-Healthcare)

This was a semester-long project I worked on for my Machine Learning class. 

* Real world data of over 100,000 instances was taken from 130 U.S hospitals. The dataset included various attributes including patient diagnoses and if the patient was readmitted.
* The best model was Random Forest, however other models including Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine were used.
* Cluster analysis identified key personas likely to be readmitted
* Project culminated in a series of business-focused recommendations to address hospital readmissions amongst diabetes patients.
