# [Project 1: Clustering Online Retail Customers](https://github.com/yani-iben/online-retail-clustering-practice)
* This project applies customer segmentation techniques on the Online Retail dataset provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
* By leveraging exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, outlier detection, and K-Means clustering, the project identifies key customer clusters and generates tailored business recommendations based on their purchasing behavior.


Skills Demonstrated:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized patterns in customer behavior, transaction trends, and purchasing frequency.
- Data Cleaning: Removed null values, duplicate entries, and erroneous data to ensure high-quality inputs.
- Outlier Detection: Identified and separated outlier customers to avoid skewing clustering results.
- K-Means Clustering:
- Applied K-Means to non-outlier customer data to detect meaningful groupings based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value (RFM).
Ran K-Means separately on outlier segments to investigate high-impact customer clusters.

# [Project 2: Banking Campaign Prediction with XGBoost]([https://github.com/yani-iben/Banking-XGBoost/tree/main])

This project uses **XGBoost** to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit following a Portuguese bankâ€™s marketing campaign. Built with `Python`, `scikit-learn`, `TargetEncoder`, and `XGBClassifier`, the pipeline processes campaign and demographic data to classify outcomes.

Feature importance analysis highlights key drivers of campaign success, including **customer age** and **employment variation rate**.

# [Project 3: Data Analytics in Healthcare](https://github.com/yani-iben/Data-Analytics-in-Healthcare)
This was a semester-long project I worked on for my Machine Learning class. 

* Real world data of over 100,000 instances was taken from 130 U.S hospitals. The dataset included various attributes including patient diagnoses and if the patient was readmitted.
* The best model was Random Forest, however other models including Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine were used.
* Cluster analysis identified key personas likely to be readmitted
* Project culminated in a series of business-focused recommendations to address hospital readmissions amongst diabetes patients.

# [Project 4: Telecommunications Customer Churn Analysis](https://github.com/yani-iben/Customer-Churn-Decision-Tree-Analysis)

This dataset simulates customer behavior for a fictional telecommunications company. It contains demographic information, account details, services subscribed to, and whether the customer ultimately churned (stopped using the service) or not. The data is synthetically generated but designed to reflect realistic patterns often found in telecom churn scenarios.

The purpose of the project is to predict whether a customer will churn or not. THe main model used was a Decision Tree model. In addition, the project includes feature importance analysis based on information gain.

* Utilized a Decision Tree model within Python

# [Project 5: Hotel Relational Database](https://github.com/yani-iben/Hotel-Customer-Satisfaction/tree/main)

- **Relational Database Creation for Wilted Lotus**  
  - Designed and implemented a relational database in SQL to support hotel operations and analytics.  
  - Developed tables for key entities such as `Guest_Stay`, `Cleans`, `Orders`, `Supplier`, and `StaysIn` to manage data efficiently.  
  - Established relationships between entities using primary and foreign keys, ensuring data integrity.

- **Executed Queries to Identify and Resolve Business Problems**  
  - Queried customer feedback scores to identify seasonal trends in guest satisfaction.  
  - Analyzed feedback from repeat versus one-time customers to assess the impact of service quality on retention.  
  - Investigated the effect of late room cleaning on housekeeping scores by analyzing cleaning times.  
  - Evaluated supply chain processes by analyzing order times and delivery delays to identify inefficiencies.  
  - Identified specific suppliers contributing to delivery delays and proposed solutions.

- **Data Visualization Using R**  
  - Created bar charts to illustrate seasonal fluctuations in feedback scores across different service categories.  
  - Utilized boxplots to compare feedback scores between repeat and one-time guests, highlighting trends.  
  - Interpreted visualizations to support data-driven recommendations for operational improvements.  
  - Integrated insights from visual analysis with SQL query results for comprehensive reporting.  

# [Project 6: WDI Data Visualization Project](https://github.com/yani-iben/WDI-Healthcare)

This project was a semester long project focusing on healthcare and education spending across OECD countries. Along with the data visualization aspect, this project involved final presentations as well as a research report. Ultimately, my time incorporated analysis from R to develop a policy recommendation regarding allocating healthcare spending to boost survival rate.

# [Project 7: TV Show Descriptive and Predictive Analytics](https://github.com/yani-iben/TV-Show-Predictive-Modeling/tree/main)

This project was inspired by the need to understand audience engagement with Emily in Paris and inform storytelling decisions for its upcoming season. By analyzing the show's transcripts and audience emotions, we aimed to uncover the factors influencing satisfaction and predict viewer ratings. Through advanced analytics and predictive modeling, the project provided actionable insights to guide the creative process.

- **Analyzed Show Transcripts for Sentiment and Themes**
  - Conducted sentiment analysis and topic modeling on Emily in Paris show transcripts to identify dominant themes and sentiments.
  - Generated a Word Cloud to visualize recurring concepts and key emotional drivers.
  - Performed emotional analysis to overcome limitations of traditional sentiment analysis, uncovering nuanced audience responses.

- **Developed Predictive Models to Inform Ratings**
  - Built and evaluated predictive models, including time series regression and Random Forest, to predict IMDb ratings based on   emotional data.
  - Identified that fear and suspense drove higher ratings, while disgust indicated conflict and joy, trust, and surprise shaped overall satisfaction.
  - Optimized Random Forest as the most accurate model, demonstrating strong predictive performance.

- **Visualized Emotional and Thematic Insights**
  - Designed visualizations, such as emotion breakdowns and Word Clouds, to communicate findings to non-technical stakeholders.
  - Mapped sentiment and emotional trends over time to highlight changes in viewer perceptions.
  - Combined visual insights with predictive analytics to support actionable recommendations for season 5 storytelling.
